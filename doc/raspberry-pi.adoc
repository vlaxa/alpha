:note-sudo: “sudo” means the process will start with administrator privileges and may require your account password (if you are eligible for administrator rights).


== Prerequisites

* BigClown products (Bridge Module, sensors, actuators, ...)
* Raspberry Pi 3
* Power adapter with USB Micro-B plug (power for Raspberry Pi)
* USB cable type A to Micro-B (between Bridge Module and Raspberry Pi)
* MicroSD card (at least 4 GiB) – http://elinux.org/RPi_SD_cards[make sure the card is compatible]
* MicroSD card reader
* Ethernet (LAN) cable
* LAN with DHCP server and internet connectivity
* Desktop environment (Windows, OS X, Linux)
* Administrator privileges (to write on the MicroSD card)


== Prepare MicroSD card for Raspberry Pi

. Download HypriotOS image https://docs.google.com/a/bigclown.com/uc?id=0B5pXL_JAACMvYU9DQm8xbFFvSkU&export=download[{hypriot-zip}].

NOTE: BigClown has changed the default hostname to “hub” in the original image. No other changes have been made.


=== On Windows desktop

[start=2]
. Unzip the image (e.g. using http://www.7-zip.org[7-Zip]).

. Write `{hypriot-img}` to MicroSD card (e.g. using https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/files/latest/download[Win32 Disk Imager]).


=== On OS X desktop

[start=2]
. Open Terminal and navigate to your folder with downloads, for example:
+
    cd ~/Downloads

. Unzip the downloaded image:
[source, subs="attributes"]
unzip {hypriot-zip}

. Insert the MicroSD card to your Mac and find out what is the disk identifier (it will be /dev/diskX):
+
    diskutil list

. You have to unmount the disk (replace X with the appropriate identifier):
+
    diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX

. Write the image to the card (replace X with the appropriate identifier):
+
[source, subs="attributes"]
sudo dd if={hypriot-img} of=/dev/rdiskX bs=1m
+
NOTE: {note-sudo}
+
This will take some time.
If you get a “permission denied” message, please make sure your MicroSD card is not write-protected (e.g. by SD card adapter).

. Eject the card (replace X with the appropriate identifier):
+
    diskutil eject /dev/diskX


=== On Linux desktop

[start=2]
. Open Terminal and navigate to your folder with downloads, for example:
[source, subs="attributes"]
cd ~/Downloads

. Unzip the downloaded image:
[source, subs="attributes"]
unzip {hypriot-zip}

. Insert the MicroSD card to your Linux desktop and find out what is the disk identifier (it will be /dev/sdX):
+
    lsblk

. You have to unmount all disk partitions (replace X with the appropriate identifier):
+
    sudo umount /dev/sdX?
+
NOTE: {note-sudo}

. Write the image to the card (replace X with the appropriate identifier):
[source, subs="attributes"]
sudo dd if={hypriot-img} of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress
+
This will take some time.
If you get a “permission denied” message, please make sure your MicroSD card is not write-protected (e.g. by SD card adapter).

. Eject the card (replace X with the appropriate identifier):
+
    eject /dev/sdX


== Boot Raspberry Pi

. Insert the MicroSD card to Raspberry Pi.
. Plug-in the Ethernet cable to Raspberry Pi.
. Connect the USB power adapter to Raspberry Pi.


== Log-in to Raspberry Pi

Next step is to login to Raspberry Pi via SSH terminal.

You can access the device in two ways:

[loweralpha]
. Using IP address (you have to determine what is the assigned address from the DHCP server).
. Using zeroconf mechanism by accessing “hub.local” host (this mechanism should work on any recent desktop).


=== On Windows desktop

. Download http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html[PuTTY].

. Open PuTTY and open SSH session:
** Use hostname: *hub.local* or *raspberry-ip-address*
** Use login: *pirate*
** Use password: *hypriot*


=== On OS X & Linux desktop

. Open Terminal and connect to Raspberry Pi:
[loweralpha]
.. using IP address: `ssh pirate@raspberry-ip-address`,
.. or using zeroconf name: `ssh pirate@hub.local`.
. Enter password: *hypriot*.


== First-time setup on Raspberry Pi

. Change password:
+
    passwd

. Create data directory for container:
+
    sudo mkdir /var/hub


== Notes for Raspberry Pi 2

If you are using Raspberry Pi 2, it is necessary to replace Caddy webserver binary to work properly.
