== Run Clown.Hub software on {host-name}

BigClown uses Docker container technology for seamless software delivery.

Pull Docker image from Docker Hub and run the container in one command:

[source, subs="attributes"]
----
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 1883:1883 --privileged -v /dev:/dev \
  -v {host-hub-path}:/var/hub -h hub-container --name hub {image-name}
----

You can stop container by:

    docker stop hub

And start it again by:

    docker start hub


== Open the browser and play with the gadgets

Navigate to URL https://hub.local:8080/dashboard or https://localhost:8080/dashboard.

NOTE: Be aware that the connection is not encrypted, so it’s not safe to access it over public internet.


== MQTT playground

* Look at measured values (this will subscribe to messages from MQTT broker running inside the container):
[source]
docker exec hub mosquitto_sub -v -t 'nodes/bridge/0/#'

* Set relay to “true” state (this will publish message to MQTT broker running inside the container):
[source]
docker exec hub \
  mosquitto_pub -t nodes/bridge/0/relay/i2c0-3b/set -m '{"state": true}'

* Set relay to “false” state:
[source]
docker exec hub \
  mosquitto_pub -t nodes/bridge/0/relay/i2c0-3b/set -m '{"state": false}'

* If you want to see values from a simulator (running as parallel process inside the container):
[source]
docker exec hub mosquitto_sub -v -t 'nodes/bridge/simulator/#'
